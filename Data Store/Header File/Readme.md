## Overview

This C++ project includes implementations of LinkedList, Stack, and Queue. It showcases basic operations and usage examples for each data structure.

## LinkedList

The `LinkedList` class provides functionality for a simple linked list. It includes methods for inserting at the first and last positions, and displaying the elements.

## Stack

The `Stack` class demonstrates a basic stack implementation. It supports push, pop, and display operations. The stack can handle both integers and strings.

## Queue

The `Queue` class (not yet implemented) will showcase a basic queue implementation.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
