# Data Structure and Algorithms

## 1D Array Operations
1. **Merge & Reverse Array:** Merges two arrays and reverses the resulting array.
2. **Unique Array Check:** Checks if all elements in an array are unique.
3. **Common Element Check:** Checks for common elements between two arrays.
4. **Occurrences of Element:** Counts the occurrences of a specific element in an array.
5. **Element Check:** Checks if each element of an array satisfies a condition.

## 2D Array Operations
1. **Sum of Array Elements:** Calculates the sum of all elements in a 2D array.
2. **Merge Arrays:** Merges two 2D arrays.

## Data Structures
1. **Stack:** Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.
2. **Queue:** First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure.
3. **Singly Linked List:** Linear data structure where elements are linked sequentially.
4. **Doubly Linked List:** Linear data structure with elements linked in both forward and backward directions.

## Greedy Algorithms
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traverses a graph depth-wise.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Traverses a graph breadth-wise.
3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finds the shortest path in a weighted graph.
4. **Knapsack Problem:** Solves the knapsack problem using a greedy approach.
5. **0/1 Knapsack Problem:** Solves the 0/1 knapsack problem using a greedy approach.

## Searching Algorithms
1. **Linear Search:** Searches for an element sequentially in an array.
2. **Binary Search:** Searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval.
3. **Ternary Search:** Searches for an element in a sorted array by dividing the search interval into three parts.
4. **Heap Searching:** Searches for an element in a heap data structure.

## Sorting Algorithms
1. **Bubble Sort:** Sorts an array by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Insertion Sort:** Sorts an array by repeatedly inserting elements into the sorted part of the array.
3. **Selection Sort:** Sorts an array by repeatedly selecting the minimum element and placing it at the beginning.
4. **Merge Sort:** Sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves.
5. **Quick Sort:** Sorts an array by selecting a pivot element, partitioning the array around the pivot, and recursively sorting the subarrays.
