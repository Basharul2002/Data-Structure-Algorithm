# Greedy Algorithms in C++

This C++ project demonstrates the implementation of various greedy algorithms. The implemented algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Dijkstra's algorithm, and two versions of the Knapsack problem (Knapsack and 0/1 Knapsack).

## Overview

This project provides C++ implementations of well-known greedy algorithms. Each algorithm is implemented in a modular and understandable manner for educational purposes.

## Depth-First Search (DFS)

The `DFS.cpp` file contains the implementation of Depth-First Search algorithm.

## Breadth-First Search (BFS)

The `BFS.cpp` file contains the implementation of Breadth-First Search algorithm.

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

The `Dijkstra.cpp` file contains the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph.

## Knapsack Problem

The `Knapsack.cpp` file contains the implementation of the Knapsack problem, a classic optimization problem.

## 0/1 Knapsack Problem

The `01Knapsack.cpp` file contains the implementation of the 0/1 Knapsack problem, a variation of the Knapsack problem.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler
